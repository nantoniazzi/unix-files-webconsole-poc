# File managemend in Unix environment

## Directory management

In Unix environment, you can create a directory with the `mkdir <new_dir>` command.

For instance, you can create the directory `images` at the root of your system using the command:
```
mkdir /images
```

You can also create a full list of directories and subdirectories using in 1 comamand using the `-p` parameter.
```
mkdir -p /images/sub1/sub2
```
will create the complete directory hierarchy structure in one single line.

> The `mkdir` command manual is accesible here: [mkdir](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mkdir.1.html)

## File management

You can change a file timestamp using the `touch <file>` command.
```
touch /hello.txt
```
will update the access and modification time of the `hello.txt` file. If the file does not already exists on the system, it will be created with an empty content.

## In practice
@[Create an empty file called valid_file under the directory /foo/bar/valid_file]({"stubs": ["run.sh"], "command":"/bin/bash /project/target/run.sh"})
